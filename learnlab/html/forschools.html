        <p style="width:800px; font-size:20px;font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif;color:lightslategray;float:right;margin: -210 -20 0 0;">The Leanlab School Research Network is a group of innovative educators and schools across the country. Educators in the network conduct research in collaboration with new and  growing edtech companies that seek to solve real problems in classrooms. Through the  honest feedback and advice that educators give over the course of the research study, educators directly contribute to the development and innovations of edtech solutions.</p>

        <p style="font-size:18px;color:lightslategray;">When joining the School Research Network, we ask educators and schools to be available to test and/or pilot new edtech<br> tools.  After you join, we’ll get to know you and/or the school’s challenges and, using that information, we’ll match you with<br> an edtech company working to solve that problem.<br><br>If at any time, the opportunity is not of interest to you or the school, you can decline participation and remain open to future<br> opportunities. All participants are directly compensated for their time. </p><br><br><br>

        <h3 class="head3">General FAQs</h3><br><hr><br>
        <h6 class="head6" onclick="parafunction('pq1')">WHO IS ELIGIBLE TO JOIN THE NETWORK?</h6>
        <p class="p1" id="pq1">The Leanlab School Network is eligible to any PreK-12 educator and school. </p><br><hr style="border:1px solid black;"><br>
        <h6 class="head6" onclick="parafunction('pq2')">HOW CAN I GET PAID TO PARTICIPATE IN RESEARCH?</h6>
        <p class="p1" id="pq2">When a relevant research opportunity becomes available, Leanlab will reach out to teachers directly (if you have signed up as an individual) or to the school administrators (for those that signed up the whole school) to see if you are able to participate.  If so, teacher participants receive individual stipends that range from $25-500 depending on the scope of the research study. The school receives an unrestricted grant that ranges from $500-10,000 depending on the scope of the study.</p><br><hr><br>
        <h6  class="head6" onclick="parafunction('pq3')">CAN I JOIN AS AN INDIVIDUAL EDUCATOR, NOT AS A SCHOOL?</h6>
        <p class="p1" id="pq3">Yes! There are many research opportunities that become available that are meant for just one or two teachers in the school building, and Leanlab will reach out to teachers that signed up individually when such opportunities arise.  However, when the research study involves classroom implementation and/or using it with students, Leanlab will require buy-in from the administration who will need to sign an MOU (see more on this below) to ensure data privacy protections for students. As an individual, you’ll also enjoy all the other benefits of being in the school network, from special events to webinars to our newsletter and online community. </p><br><hr><br>
        <h6  class="head6" onclick="parafunction('pq4')">WHAT IS CODESIGN PRODUCT RESEARCH?</h6>
        <p class="p1" id="pq4">WHAT IS CODESIGN PRODUCT RESEARCH?
            Codesign Product Research is what we call the type of research we conduct. Codesign is based on the simple idea that the "end-users" (students, teachers, parents) in education are the people with the expertise necessary to improve research design and education products.<br> 
            
            When we codesign, we engage in a collaborative process that unites critical insights from school communities with the expertise of researchers and product developers. The end result is that we make better products for school communities.
            
             </p><br><hr><br>
        <h6   class="head6" onclick="parafunction('pq5')">HOW LONG DOES THE RESEARCH TAKE TO DO?</h6>
        <p class="p1" id="pq5">The research implementation period is dependent on the type of research. Studies can last anywhere from six weeks to one semester. </p><br><hr><br>
        <h6  class="head6" onclick="parafunction('pq6')">WHAT IS THE TIME COMMITMENT FOR THE RESEARCH STUDY?</h6>
        <p class="p1" id="pq6">Time required is highly dependent on the type of research and the study design. We can help you find the right type of study to implement in your school or district or even with individual teachers based on your school's capacity. </p><br><hr style="border:1px solid black;"><br>
        <h6  class="head6" onclick="parafunction('pq7')">HOW MANY TEACHERS AND CLASSROOMS ARE NEEDED FOR RESEARCH?</h6>
        <p class="p1" id="pq7"> The number of teachers, classrooms, students, and/or parents needed to participate in the pilot study will vary depending on the methodology established together. The most common scenario requires 4-5 teachers or support staff from one school implementing the edtech tool with students in their classrooms.</p><br><hr><br>
        <h6  class="head6" onclick="parafunction('pq8')">HOW IS THE GRANT MONEY FOR THE RESEARCH DISTRIBUTED?</h6>
        <p class="p1" id="pq8"> Total grant money is dependent on the study scope and the involvement we'll need from your school participants. We provide direct stipends to teachers and school grants up to $10K. Grant money is given on an unrestricted basis.</p><br><hr><br>
        <h6  class="head6" onclick="parafunction('pq9')">WHAT DO SCHOOLS NEED TO DO IN ORDER TO RECEIVE THE GRANT MONEY?</h6>
        <p class="p1" id="pq9">Leanlab Network Schools will sign a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with Leanlab that signals their intent to follow the steps and commit to the engagement requirements of the pilot process. This MOU will be co-created by Leanlab and your school and will outline specific study requirements. Some studies will require a data-sharing agreement.  Once a research study is completed and all requirements outlined in the MOU are met, Leanlab will send payment directly to the school or district representative. </p><br><hr style="border:1px solid black;">
